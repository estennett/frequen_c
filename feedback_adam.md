| Back-end Technology             | | | | Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class                                                         |
| Front-end Technology            | | | Front-end makes appropriate use of AJAX requests and tempting, follows basic patters of OOJS                                                                           |  (note, you were close to exceeds, but just needed to see a bit more in terms of HTML/CSS validation)|
| Code Quality                    | | | Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues                                                                                            |  (you were VERY close to exceeds here. I'd just like to see the some issues mentioned in my inline comments fixed, such as removing dead code, and I'd consider it exceptional)|
| Deployment and Functionality    | | | | App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc. App may be deployed to a service other than Heroku (e.g. Digital Ocean).              |
| Planning / Process / Submission | | | | Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of proper teamwork, such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions.  |
